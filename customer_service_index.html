    <h1>Daily Customer Service Tasks</h1>
 
<p>All of your day-to-day customer service training needs are below. Those duties include assigning tickets to specailists, responding and initiating tickets
    for external customers, training newly onboarded employees on using Service NOW, and checking the status/customer notified box for updates. We highly reccommend that you organize your desktop with different folders. For Daily Tasks having a folder
    titled "Temporary" is useful for when you must save documents that you know you will not need later. Example, when creating SNOW tickets for external customers who email you will have to save
    the files they send in order to attache them to their ticket. Also creating a designated file called "Daily Updates" makes it easier to find 
    and update the excel workbooks you will need for checking MSD Specialists tickets. Being organized in this way is a recommendation, but if you have your own organization methods
    that is ok too.

       <h1>ServiceNow Admin</h1>
       <p> One of the main and very important roles as customer service is streamlining the requests by assigning the tickets to the 
           correct service area and quality checks of tasks that are processing. Let's first get you started with understanding Service Now 
           platform and how to assign tickets. After the below video (can be accessed in training material) please access the necessary files that detail instructions for whom to assign tickets to and print for your reference.</p>

       <h1>External Customers</h1>
       <p> Only governement employees have access to request their own tickets, so outside customers such as landlords of the 
           buildings that MSD employees are tenents of must either call or email to submit requests. This will guide you on setting up 
           your configurations.

           <li>Map ASKMSD Email to Outlook
            <p>This can be done by submitting a ticket to IT to map the account name <strong>SM.FSA.DCWAS.ASKMSD</strong> to your Microsoft Outlook. You will then be able to receive 
            email and respond to emails from this account name.</p> <a href="https://usdacts-rsso.fed.onbmc.com/rsso/start"> (Link to IT Chat for Help)</a> </li>
